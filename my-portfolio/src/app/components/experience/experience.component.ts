        I used basic HTML and javascript to accomplish this, as I had not learned how to utilize front-end frameworks such as
        Angular, or React.  The application I build was interactive, so it could have utilized these, but this internship
        provided me the opportunity to really dig into how HTML and javascript work, which was a huge benefit later down the road.
